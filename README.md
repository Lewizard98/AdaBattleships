*Challenge Outline*

  *The Challenge*
  The challenge this time is to build a console based game 'Ada Battleships' to the specifications outlines in the assignment breif. This did not seem like something I initially thought would be challengeing due to having completed a similar game in Java previously for a personal project.

  There where additional specifications outside of the working game. For example:
    Additional Game modes
    PVP or PVE
    A menu system
    Auto ship placing
    Salvo mode
    and more

  *The Plan*
  When it came to how I was going to work on this, I knew I wanted to take an agile approach. The first step was to get a MVP working, that just had the basic rules of the game and no worries about fancy extras. Once this was all completed I worked my way through, adding one working feature at a time and testsing heavily at each 'release' to make sure the core game and previous features where not broken. I did this to keep a high quailty game and revisted my code to keep it neat and readable.

  *Initial Design*
  My initial design that I had was a little diferent to the finished product, I found that I did not plan enough in certain areas as I saw some things pop up that required me to change the initial plan. I tried to keep individual tasks small and keep everything done seperatly and in components with them only talking to each other when needed to prevent one change breaking too many different things.

*Development*

  *Development Standards*
  I tried to adopt and stick to some well established standards for coding while working on this project, I commented my code and kept it clear for others to see. I also limeted the scop of everything to the smallest possible scope. I kept the classes as seperate from each other and limited dependencies where I could.

  *Development Phases*
  My first phase of development, what I called 'V0' was all the parts to get the game to the MVP, it had non of the fancy extras and the code was a little rough and the ui needed tidying up, this section I focused on the minimal.
  Once I had got that done I started to test and fix. This took my a long time as a lot of bugs appeared that stumped me for a while, specifically an issue with input validation in while loops. but I managed to resolve that with some research and thinking and started making use of the 'cin.clear()' function religiously.

  The 'second' phase of development - what I called 'V1' was mostly tidying up, I refactored a lot of the code base to make things fit the standards and flow a bit better, i also spent a bit of time making the UI and menu system look a bit nicer. Testing was limited as no new features where added but I did ask a family member to test the game to get their thoughts and made some adjustments based on that feedback.

  The third phase phase was focused on meeting the merit tasks on the assignment brief - I added more gamemodes and extra features like that, to make the game more enjoyable and less barebones. I spent a lot of time testing and bug fixing, mostly because a lot of new things where added but also because a lot of the new features caused unexpected bugs in the changes from phase 1

*Evaluation*

  *Reflection*
  One of the main things I spent time on was refactoring, I kept changing how my code looked and flowed in an attempt to make it more readable and run better. I still feel like this is something that can be improved on but time is limited and it fell aside to higher priority changes like extra features and bug fixes.

  There is a lot of areas I feel I would improve on next time but I am happy with this for now, I know that I stuggle with C++ as it is a language I rarely use and so I will spend more of my own time getting more to grips with C++ as I like the similarities it has with Java and I want to be prepared for any future work with this tool.
